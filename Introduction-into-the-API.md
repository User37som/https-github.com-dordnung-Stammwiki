## General Introduction ##

Hey, welcome to the Stamm Developer Wiki. Great to see that you wanna use the API. 
Let me tell you, it's easier to use the API as you thought. Just read the next Pages and learn how to work with it.

## Where to start ##
The API is divided in six parts. 

- [**The core part**](Working-with-stamm)
- [**The client part**](Working-with-clients)
- [**The color part**](Colors-in-Stamm)
- [**The level part**](Working-with-levels)
- [**The feature part**](Scripting-Features)
- [**The block part**](Scripting-Features)

You can use the core, client, color and level part without making a feature, for the feature and block part you need to add a feature.
